# Game Project

## Overview
This project consists of two Python scripts for a simple and interactive game. The game offers two modes:

1. **Single Player Mode**: Play the game alone using the `game.py` script.
2. **Two-Player Mode**: Compete against another player using the `multiplay.py` script.

Both scripts provide a fun and engaging experience and are easy to set up and run.
